Explored the DBLP DataSet to find any relation between communities and densest subgraphs

http://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-DBLP.html

but.......

Top ten Densities from given communities were
[ 9.5 , 10.0, 10.0, 10.26, 10.8, 11.5, 13.0, 13.0, 14.2, 16.0]

Top densities from the densest subgraph algorithm
[56.56, 53.71, 51.95,....]-rounded to 2 digits

Thus we see a huge contrast between them



Now exploring the Amazon Dataset for any similarities

There seemed to be some difference in the first trial 
Rechecking...
